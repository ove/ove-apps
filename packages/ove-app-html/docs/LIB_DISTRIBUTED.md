# Distributed.js Library

This is a [JavaScript library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ove/ove-apps/master/packages/ove-app-html/src/libs/distributed.js) for distributing JavaScript function calls and variables from controllers to viewers. The `setDistributed` function distributes the execution of functions and the `watch` function propagates updates on one or more properties from controller to viewers.

This library also exposes a number of helpers, one of which is [THREE.Distributed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ove/ove-apps/master/packages/ove-app-html/src/libs/distributed/three.js), which is library for distributing Three.js functionality using the Distributed.js library.
